# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution.

## Before you open a pull request

Run the four gates. They are what CI runs, and a pull request that fails one of
them fails for everybody who pulls after it.

```bash
gofmt -l $(find . -name '*.go' -not -path '*/testdata/*' -not -name '*.kyse.go')
go build ./...
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...
```

The two filters on `gofmt` are not preference. `gofmt` is the only tool in the
chain that ignores build tags, so it reads files the compiler deliberately
excludes; `testdata/` holds fixtures that are invalid on purpose.

A change to the models, the decode or the camera loop is measured on a GPU with
`bench/fleet` before it is released, and the numbers go in the changelog entry.

## What a change has to keep true

The engine stays plain Go: no Arandu import, no package state, no `init` beyond
the main-thread pin (`tests/Unit/discipline_test.go`). `arandu.mod.toml` says
what the code does -- network, filesystem, exec -- in the same commit that makes
it do it (`tests/Unit/audit_test.go`). `contract` is the API every application
compiles against: a change there is a release with an UPGRADE.md entry.

## Style

Everything in the source is in English: identifiers, doc comments, internal
comments, error messages, log messages, and the names and messages of tests.
`pkg.go.dev` publishes the doc comments, and its readers are users of this
package.

Every exported symbol carries a doc comment saying what it does. The comment
documents the symbol and nothing else: no dates, no issue numbers, no
references to other repositories. Why a signature is what it is belongs there
when it is a fact about the code; anything else belongs in the pull request.

## Commits

One commit per logical change. Formatting is not mixed with behaviour, because
a diff that does both is a diff nobody reviews.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open an issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
